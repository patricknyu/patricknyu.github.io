    &lt;p&gt;I just completed the 11 week course in Machine Learning from Coursera.  I already had experience in machine learning and programming in Matlab (Octave was the suggested language for the course), but I still really enjoyed the class.  The course definitely felt a little watered down, I felt that there was a big lack of the difficult math and statistics that is applied in machine learning.  However, it&amp;#39;s completely understandable for an online course to do as such.  I&amp;#39;ll probably try to find another online course with more difficult math/stats in machine learning at another time.  The examples were nice, but I did feel they were a bit dumbed down.  The assignments were fun as well.  A major criticism that I have of the course is the quizzes.  The questions themselves were wonderful, however I felt that the lack of feedback on incorrect solutions really took away a lot form the course.  It was difficult to learn what I was doing wrong when I answered things incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to thank Andrew Ng for teaching the course and Tom Mosher for providing invaluable help to students such as myself.  I&amp;#39;ll be sure to look into Coursera in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Well I just spent a whole ton of time looking into static images.  It&amp;#39;s cool actually.  Jekyll is static so it&amp;#39;s smart to want to have jekyll use static images.  I don&amp;#39;t necessarily have a great use for them yet, so I haven&amp;#39;t implemented it.  I&amp;#39;ll be sure to look into it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is my first foray into Jekyll.  In the past my github page was just a crappy mainly white page I made when I was going through codeacademy&amp;#39;s html/css page.  Almost nothing worked.  This makes things a lot easier, especially since I have experience in markdown.  I like how jekyll structures the &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; folder, how it uses markdown, and how easy it is to use.  I&amp;#39;m using octopress and it makes things really easy.  I also looked into Jekyll Picture tag plug-in, but I don&amp;#39;t know too much about static images.  I&amp;#39;ll have to look into it more later.  If not obvious already, this is just a theme which I&amp;#39;ve taken and began adapting for my own use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that Jekyll is usually used in a blogging format so hopefully I&amp;#39;ll keep up with writing in here and write something actually meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve decided to post a bit of music and other things, but I&amp;#39;ll mainly be posting what I&amp;#39;m doing technically, more as a record of what I&amp;#39;m doing with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
