\opening{Dear FactSet:} 
 
\noindent I am writing to apply to your Software Engineer position. This May I am going to be finishing what has been an enlightening experience at the University of California, Berkeley.

\noindent I have an interest in this position for a couple of different reasons. First, I am an Applied Mathematics major with a Computer Science concentration. I have a strong background in both Python and Java and have taken multiple classes which have required me to use both.  Second, I communicate with my peers effectively and have served as a leader in community service organizations. Finally, one of the biggest reasons I am interested in working with FactSet is my love for difficult problems. In my time at Berkeley, I learned that I love to challenge myself. I switched into a more difficult major, did not hesitate to take demanding classes, and did all I could to demand more of myself. I want to continue to find opportunities to challenge myself after I graduate, and I know that working at FactSet will provide that for me.

\noindent Please feel free to ask me any questions - my contact information can be found here and on my resume. Also, I am located just across the Bay, so I am just a stone's throw away. Thank you for your consideration and time.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
