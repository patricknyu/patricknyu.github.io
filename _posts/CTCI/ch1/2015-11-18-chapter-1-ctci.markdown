I'm starting from the beginning.  I've done most of these problems and for the most part, they aren't too dificult.  I'm rewriting them in Python which feels like cheating sometimes.  I might fill in this intro later.

#Arrays and Strings

###Hash Tables

###ArrayList

###StringBuffer

This is extremely useful!
