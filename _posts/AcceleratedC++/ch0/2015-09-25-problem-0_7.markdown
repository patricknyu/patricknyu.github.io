###Q:
What about this one?

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
/* This is a comment that extends over several lines
because it uses /* and */ as its starting and ending delimiters */
std::cout << "Does this work?" << std::endl;
return 0;
}
```
###A:

No, we have a problem since the /* starts the comment and it gets ended by the first */.  This means that the extra " and */ as its starting and ending delimiters */" will not be interpreted as a comment, giving an error.
