###Q:
...and this one?

```c++
#include <iostream> int main()
{
// This is a comment that extends over several lines
// by using // at the beginning of each line instead of using /* // or */ to delimit comments.
std::cout << "Does this work?" << std::endl;
return 0; 
}
```

###A:
This is valid.  All the stuff for the entire line after each // starts is a comment, so none if it is interpreted.

The rest of the program is valid.
