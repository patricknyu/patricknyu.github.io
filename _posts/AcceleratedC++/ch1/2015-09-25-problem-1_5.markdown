###Q:
Is this program valid? If so, what does it do? If not, say why not, and rewrite it to be valid.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() 
{
	{ std::string s = "a string";
	{ std::string x = s + ", really";
	std::cout << s << std::endl;} 
	std::cout << x << std::endl;}
return 0;
}
```

This is not valid.  The std::cout << x<< std::endl; line doesn't work out since we cannot see the x that point.

Here's a rewrite

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main() 
{
	{std::string s = "a string";
	std::string x = s + ", really";
	std::cout << s << std::endl;
	std::cout << x << std::endl;}
return 0;
}
```
