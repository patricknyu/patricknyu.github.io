###Q:
What about this one? What if we change }} to };} in the third line from the end? 

```c++	
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main()
{
	{ const std::string s = "a string"; std::cout << s << std::endl;
	{ const std::string s = "another string"; std::cout << s << std::endl; }}
	return 0;
}
```

###A:
This is valid.  The s = "another string" doesn't affect the first s.

If we change it, doesn't change the program.  At the location of the semi-colon, there's nothing to get rid of anyways.
