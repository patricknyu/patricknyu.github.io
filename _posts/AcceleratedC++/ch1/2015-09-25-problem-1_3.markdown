###Q:
Is the following program valid? If so, what does it do? If not, why not?

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
	{ const std::string s = "a string"; std::cout << s << std::endl; }
	{ const std::string s = "another string"; std::cout << s << std::endl; }
	return 0;
}
```
###A:
This is valid.  We can use the same const strings s when we keep them inside the curly brackets since it deletes it from memory once the curly brackets end.
