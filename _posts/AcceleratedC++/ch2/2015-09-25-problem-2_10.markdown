###Q:
Explain each of the uses of std:: in the following program:

```c++
int main()
{
	int k = 0;
	while (k != n)
	{
		// invariant: we have written k asterisks so far
		using std::cout;
		cout << "*";
		++k;
	}
	std::cout << std::endl; //std:: is required here
	return 0; 
}
```
###A:
In the first instance we use the "using" statement to use the synonym of just simply cout for ```std::cout```.  Hence, in the next line we do not need to write ```std::cout``` and instead just use cout.

The second instance occurs out side the curly bracers which we wrote using ```std::cout```, so we need to write out ```std::cout << std::endl```.  It is a different scope.
