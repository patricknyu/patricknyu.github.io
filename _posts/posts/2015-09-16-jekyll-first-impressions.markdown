This is my first foray into Jekyll.  In the past my github page was just a crappy mainly white page I made when I was going through codeacademy's html/css page.  Almost nothing worked.  This makes things a lot easier, especially since I have experience in markdown.  I like how jekyll structures the `_site` folder, how it uses markdown, and how easy it is to use.  I'm using octopress and it makes things really easy.  I also looked into Jekyll Picture tag plug-in, but I don't know too much about static images.  I'll have to look into it more later.  If not obvious already, this is just a theme which I've taken and began adapting for my own use.

It seems that Jekyll is usually used in a blogging format so hopefully I'll keep up with writing in here and write something actually meaningful.

I've decided to post a bit of music and other things, but I'll mainly be posting what I'm doing technically, more as a record of what I'm doing with my life.
