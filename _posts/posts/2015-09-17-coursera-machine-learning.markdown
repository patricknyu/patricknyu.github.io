I just completed the 11 week course in Machine Learning from Coursera.  I already had experience in machine learning and programming in Matlab (Octave was the suggested language for the course), but I still really enjoyed the class.  The course definitely felt a little watered down, I felt that there was a big lack of the difficult math and statistics that is applied in machine learning.  However, it's completely understandable for an online course to do as such.  I'll probably try to find another online course with more difficult math/stats in machine learning at another time.  The examples were nice, but I did feel they were a bit dumbed down.  The assignments were fun as well.  A major criticism that I have of the course is the quizzes.  The questions themselves were wonderful, however I felt that the lack of feedback on incorrect solutions really took away a lot form the course.  It was difficult to learn what I was doing wrong when I answered things incorrectly.

Finally, I want to thank Andrew Ng for teaching the course and Tom Mosher for providing invaluable help to students such as myself.  I'll be sure to look into Coursera in the future.
